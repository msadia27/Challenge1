# Code Refactor Starter Code

In this assignment, I will enforce semantics HTML elements and CSS styling and positioning.  Additionally, we will also incorporate accessibility standards on a webpage. Lastly, ensuring that attributes are in sequential order. All of these will be implemented in an already existing index.html and style.css file

Revisions and URL websites below: 

1. I changed the website "title" to HORISEON.
2. I added all ALT attributes for all 6 pictures for accessibility standards
3. I removed any repeated CSS styling and kept 1 class per CSS style.
4. I changed some HTML semantics from div to appropriate html semantics such as article, nav, aside, and section.
